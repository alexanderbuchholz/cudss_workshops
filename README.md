# Python for Data Science
For starting the workshop, please make sure you have anaconda installed. We will use python 3 for this workshop. 

The material for the course is available at 
https://github.com/alexanderbuchholz/cudss_workshops/blob/master/python_for_data_science_workshop/python_for_data_science_workshop.ipynb

## Getting the data and the notebook
If you are using a unix system and have git installed, you can use the shell command 
```
git clone https://github.com/alexanderbuchholz/cudss_workshops/ 
```
to clone download the folder with the notebook and data to your computer. A different solution (for windows or without a shell you can just download and unzip the github repository). 

Once you have downloaded the repository, open a jupyter (anaconda) notebook with Python 3.
